## üì¶ Features

- **Configurable Protocol State**  
  Initialize and update global parameters: admin, vaults, fees, limits, and feature flags.

- **SOL Staking ‚Üí LXR Purchases**  
  Users can stake SOL to purchase LXR, with early-bird bonus logic and dynamic pricing.

- **Reward Accrual**  
  - Rewards in **SOL**: tracked via `reward_per_token_sol_stored`.  
  - Rewards in **LXR**: accrued via buybacks and distributed pro-rata with forfeiture rules.

- **Buyback Engine**  
  Uses SOL rewards accrued in the stake account to purchase LXR via Raydium CPMM, sending LXR to the reward vault and fees to treasury.

- **Redemption**  
  Users can redeem their share of accrued LXR rewards. If their current holdings are less than their base holdings, a portion is forfeited to treasury.

- **Emergency Controls**  
  Admin can withdraw vault funds, deactivate stake, or withdraw staked SOL in emergencies.

- **Event-Driven Indexing**  
  Emits structured events (`GlobalConfigInitialized`, `ConfigUpdated`, `LxrPurchased`, etc.) for off-chain monitoring.
